A personal journey to reach carbon negative in 2 years!! Really?

# An Attempt to Erase My Carbon Foot Prints from Past to the Present to the Future!

## Lowering our carbon foot print for the future is very tough, right? 
My carbon footprint is right about 20 tons due to several international flights. Do you know yours?

## Do you every wonder what happens to the carbons emitted since we were born? 

## What if we want to truly erase our impacts on this world in order to be as gentle with the natural environment as the other species sharing this world? 
### Why in the world ?
Because, we can if we really wanted and make it a priority. Then, why don't we? 

Life gets in the way! We live our lives today with the credit from the future generations. 

Isn't it obvious? 

Would you steal from your kid's piggy bank in order to pay for a to-go coffee ? 

Then, why do we keep doing this? Why don't we change? Why don't we hedge our risks for our kids, environment, species etc?  

Maybe we are addicted to our modern life sytles so much that we don't know how to live without them. We are so far removed from our food production systems, and our interaction with nature is mostly limited to a few parks sprinkled on  downtowns like a few olives on a giant pizza. We/I most probaby spend time in driving more to get to a park than actual walking/hiking/enjoying in the park. 

### How ?
How do we approach such a complex problem that overwhelms even the brightest minds of the world for decades, and confuses some more than provide answers. Maybe we should take a ten thousand feet bird's eye view of the problem first and then zoom into the details in different areas. 

I would like to use a tree approach to our carbon emissions to properly size and categrozie the problem and identify the bigger branches/contributers and find ways to address them. 

### What ? 
What tools are available to us to do this? To asses, measure, guesstimate, categorize, prioritize, and slowly start adressing.
